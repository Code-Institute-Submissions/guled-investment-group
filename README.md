### Project Goals ### 

The **goal** for this project is to **introduce** to **potential investors** an investment fund managed by **Guled Investment Group**, including: what an investment fund is, who manages it and commission fee structure.

### User Goals ###

* **Learn and Understand** what an investment fund is and how it works.
* **Find out** whether investing into an investment is viable and beneficial to user. 
* **Contact the company** for **more information** and request to be contacted, by providing contact details, to **learn more** about:
    * How **investment funds** work. 
    * The company's **profit sharing** and **commission structure**.

* **Be reassured** that the investment fund and company, that includes investment managers, are appropriately  **accredited** and **licensed**.
 
### User Stories ###

* As a **user**, I want an **easily navigable website** that is **straight to the point** and leads me directly to the **relevant information**, avoiding **unnecessarily tedious design obstacles**.

### Site Owner Goals ###
* As a **site owner**, I want to **provide the correct information** on **investment funds** and **effectively define in simple terms** what it is. This is that **user** is **well-informed** before **making a decision** to **invest**. 
* As a **site owner**, I want to **market** to **users** about the **investment fund** we manage and **show what makes it different**, in terms of **how we manage it** and **commission fee structure**.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

**Requirements**
* **Navigate** the website using the navbar that scrolls to the requested section.
* The **website** should be a **one-page** website to keep users engaged. 
* A **full functioning contact form** that allows user to input **contact details and enquiries**.
* A **fully functioning learn more** button in the header of the website.

**Expectations**
* **Visually appealing website** kept **simple and easy to use** and **without** any complicated features.
* **Built** to look **professional** and with **high-quality design** should **reflect the service provided**.
* **Provide** the **most relevant information** that is **most helpful** to the user in order to **keep things short**. 

### Design Choices ###
---
When designing the website, I used the wine delivery bootstrap website from 
[Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) "Bootstrapping your next big idea" lesson 
in the User-centric Frontend Development module as a template on which I completely customised. 

**Fonts**

I tried to look for very simple fonts that were very easy to read and looked professional. 
I chose [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for headings and 
[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) for text. 

**Colours**

I used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/0a0a0a-575a5e-c40b08-246b94-f4f7f5) colour generator 
to find the colour scheme that suited best for the project. 

The **purpose** for each colour:
 
* **Davys Grey** (#575A5E): for navbar link font, body font and line under headings; 
* **International Orange Engineering** (#C40B08): for contact submit button, learn more button and some body text; 
* **Sapphire Blue** (#246B94): for logo and headers;
* **Cultured** (#F4F7F5): for most body backgrounds, and callout font colour;

### Wireframing ###

For **wireframing**, I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I used it to create **simple** wireframes 
showing the basic structure on which I built the website on. Some features maybe removed or added during 
development.

* [Tablet](https://github.com/gammaled/guled-investment-group/blob/master/wireframes/GIG%20tablet.pdf)
* [Mobile](https://github.com/gammaled/guled-investment-group/blob/master/wireframes/GIG%20mobile.pdf)

<details>
  <summary><strong>What didn't make the cut and why:</strong></summary>
  My <strong>wireframes</strong> and the website in each display format have ended up looking different to each other. This is my first project in UI/UX and I have noticed that what I planned to do did not work in reality in terms of UX/UI. My wireframes looked amazing but it did not translate so well on the different device screen. 

  This is my first project in UI/UX, as a result there were a few features that ended up taking too much time and became too difficult for me to do.
